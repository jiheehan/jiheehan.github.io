#[introduction]
* Propose  a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks and two simple global hyperparameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy
* A class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications
* Focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks
  * Many papers on small networks focus only on size but do not consider
